The object of the game is to have the "Player Guess" number equal to the "Number to Guess" by pressing on the crystals on the screen. The "number to guess" is a randomly generated number that will appear on the screen at the start of a new game. The crystals on the screen will also be randomly assigned a number between 1-12. The player will then have to click on the crystals to figure out the value for that game and use the crystals to try and get the "player guess" to equal the "number to guess". The game will be over once the two numbers match or the "player guess" is greater than the "number to guess". At this point the score counter will increase based on if the player won or lost and a new game will automatically start.
